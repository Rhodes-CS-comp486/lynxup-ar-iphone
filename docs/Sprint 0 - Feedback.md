## Planning Document Feedback (Group): 

- The content of the first bullet was a good start for your system description, but then you switched to a list of design details. Your system description was meant to be similar in form and content to an abstract for the Rhodes Symposium. (I mentioned this in class, but you guys may have missed it.) 
- Your architectural description is great. You also did a good job of showing all of the system components in your diagram. My only suggestion is that your arrows/lines between components should be more consistent. (Why not just use bi- directional solid arrows for each connection? If you need something else, add a legend to explain the intent.)
- Your epics need some work. The intent of some of your epics is unclear (e.g., is the 'locating items' epic about guidance to points of interest or the delivery of 'fun facts'?). You also mentioned a lot of functionality in your bulleted list that don't have a clear correspondence with your epics (e.g., leaderboards, scanning buildings, and XP).
- Your non- functional requirements are great. Very precise.
- Your technologies/frameworks look good.
- Your MVP looks good, but might be overly ambitious. The XP system with leaderboards may need to be a stretch goal, so that you can focus on the core use experience in AR mode/quest mode. Time will tell. :)
- Your roadmap is missing two sprints and doesn't show when you are targetting your MVP's completion. Not sure what the personalization system entails. Also I don't know what connecting the backend to the frontend means in terms of features. I understand that you have a lot of uncertainty at this point, but your roadmap definitely needs some work.

## Requirements Feedback (Group): 

- Your user stories look great.
- Titles are consistent.
- Everything is linked back to an epic, which is great.
- No acceptance criteria :(
- I don't see any indication on your Kanban board that you discussed the level of effort for these user stories.
- It looks like you might have done some prioritization, but I'm surprised 'US2' is at the top.
